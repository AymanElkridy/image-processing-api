# Image Processing API

## Description:
This is an API that takes an image file name and desired width and height, then resizes the image from the [images](assets/images/) directory and output the resized image in the [thumbnails](assets/thumbnails/) directory, saving it using its original name concatenated to `-${width}-${height}.jpg`.
